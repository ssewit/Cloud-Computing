# Deep Learning Pipelines for Apache

## Introduction

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves the use of artificial neural networks to analyze and interpret data. Deep learning is characterized by: Multiple layers, Large datasets, Automatic feature extraction, Improved accuracy.

Pipelines are a crucial concept in deep learning, especially when working with large-scale data and complex models. 
Apache Spark MLlib is a scalable machine learning library built on top of Apache Spark, a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. MLlib provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms and utilities.Common use cases for Apache Spark MLlib include: 
Predictive maintenance, 
Customer segmentation, 
Recommendation systems, 
Image classification, 
Natural language processing.

## Design

Here we will be using Deep Learning Pipelines for Apache Spark.
Technologies used are: 
Deep Learning Pipelines by Databricks, 
Apache Spark, 
Keras, 
TensorFlow,  
Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Cluster Environment Setup

    - Install spark-deep-learning via Maven and attach to cluster
    
    - Ensure Spark version 2.0+ 
    
    - CPU/GPU instances
    
    - Install TensorFlow, Keras, h5py via PyPI
